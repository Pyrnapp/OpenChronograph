=== Creating Custom Watch Dials With Python and PCBs ===

== Why use PCBs? ==
The PCB manufacturing process is great for watch dials for a few reasons:

*Resolution*
It's common even for cheaper board houses to offer 6mil/0.15mm traces, and some fabs do 3mil/0.075mm. On paper these feature sizes correspond roughly to 170 and 340 DPI, which isn't on its face particularly impressive; however, in practice the PCB process offers very sharp, clean edges with tolerances well below these numbers. 

*Materials*
The PCB process offers a surprising variety of options here. Typically board houses offer PCBS with a fiberglass substrate, and this can be easily drilled, sanded, and glued. A wide range of thickness options are also available, and boards as thin as 0.6mm can be ordered at no extra cost. Other substrate options such as aluminum and flexible Kapton are also available, though those are more expensive.

In terms of metallic surfaces, exposed copper can be electroplated in either nickel or gold as part of the standard PCB fab process, and at very little additional cost. It's also not uncommon for a additional electropolishing step to be offered. 

*Cost*
For small, two-layer boards, custom PCBs are very cheap. A dozen custom dials can be had for less than $40. 


== Why not Printing? ==
While there are a number of photo printing shops that offer high DPI prints in various gloss finishes, these tend to look fuzzy and flat. The printed paper must also be drilled to allow hand posts to pass through, which can result in fraying of the paper and wrinkling of the gloss. The outer edge must similarly be trimmed, and then the whole thing must be adhered to something such as a steel backing plate. There may be a printing workflow that produces good results, but the path is less clear compared to the PCB process.
